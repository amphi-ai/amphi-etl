# Building Amphi from Source

This document explains how to build Amphi from source code. Amphi consists of two main components:
1. `jupyterlab-amphi`: The core JupyterLab extension containing the main application logic
2. `amphi-etl`: The full Amphi ETL application that builds upon the core extension

## üëâ Prerequisites üëà
Python must be installed on your machine.
Before starting the build process, we strongly recommend setting up a Python virtual environment. This helps avoid conflicts between Python packages and ensures a clean installation. You can create one using either `venv` or `conda`:

### Creating a Virtual Environment

Using venv:

#### On Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
another example
```bash
python -m venv C:\Users\yourusername\building_amphi
cd C:\Users\yourusername\building_amphi
Scripts\activate
```
on cmd, you must see the name of your virtual environment on the left.

#### On macOS/Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Using conda:
```bash
# Create a new environment
conda create -n amphi python=3.x
conda activate amphi
```

Keep this virtual environment active throughout the entire build process.

## üë∑ Building jupyterlab-amphi üë∑

The first step is to build the core JupyterLab extension.

1. Navigate to the jupyterlab-amphi directory: (here the cd.. is because you have to go back in the folder hierarchy)
```bash
cd ..
cd jupyterlab-amphi
```

2. Install and build the extension:

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
jlpm install
jlpm run build
python3 -m pip install .
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
pip install jupyterlab
jlpm install
jlpm run build
python -m pip install .
```
check that the extension is really installed with
```bash
python -m jupyter labextension list
```

3. To test the extension in JupyterLab:
These commands will launch jupyterlab with the extension. Please note you shouldn't get the Amphi interface here. It is highly recommanded to clear your browser cache before this step.
**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
jupyter lab --notebook-dir=/path/to/your/workspace
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
jupyter lab --notebook-dir=C:\path\to\your\workspace
```

Replace `/path/to/your/workspace` or `C:\path\to\your\workspace` with your desired workspace directory (i.e. the directory where are your pipelines, not your building or installation directory). 

Note: You can add `--ContentManager.allow_hidden=True` to the launch command if you want to show hidden files in the file browser.
to interrupt , close your browser tab and ctrl+c on cmd
## üë∑ Building amphi-etl üë∑

After successfully building `jupyterlab-amphi`, you can proceed with building the full Amphi ETL application.

1. Navigate to the amphi-etl directory:
```bash
cd ../amphi-etl
```

2. Modify requirements.txt to use the local jupyterlab-amphi build (save a copy somewhere):
   - Open `requirements.txt`
   - Find the line containing `jupyterlab-amphi==X.X.X`
   - Replace it with `../jupyterlab-amphi`

3. Install the requirements:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Launch Amphi ETL:
```bash
jupyter lab --notebook-dir=/path/to/your/workspace
```
(Use appropriate path format for Windows as shown above)

if ok, don't forget to replace the requirements.txt with the save you made before going further with git.

## üëì Component Overview üëì

- **jupyterlab-amphi**: This is the core extension that contains the main application logic. It can be run independently within JupyterLab for development and testing purposes.
  
- **amphi-etl**: This is the complete Amphi ETL application. It incorporates the `jupyterlab-amphi` extension and adds Amphi's custom theme, styling, and additional features to create a standalone application experience.

## üêõ Troubleshooting üêõ

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated
2. Verify all prerequisites are installed correctly
3. Check that paths in commands match your system's directory structure
4. Make sure you're using compatible versions of Python and JupyterLab

## üóà Notes üóà

- Always use the virtual environment when installing Python packages to maintain a clean development environment
- The build process must be completed in order: first jupyterlab-amphi, then amphi-etl
- if you use several Python releases (like 3.12 & 3.13), be sure that you're using a supported release when building and that your virtual environment is built with the same version. The easiest way is to set this version as the default. You can check with python -V before creating the virtual environment and inside the virtual environment. You can also check you're using Python from the virtual environment with the where python command (Windows) or which command (Macos/linux). The first result should be in your virtual environement.
- virtual environments are not totally isolated and, depending of your environment variables, you may have a fallback mechanism, meaning that when not finding a package in your virtual environment, it will take it from the system, causing either errors or false positive during building process.

## ‚úö Adding a new component ‚úö
1. a component is stored as a .tsx file in the amphi-etl\jupyterlab-amphi\packages\pipeline-components-core\src\components repository, within a sub-folder related to its category.
Note there is a  amphi-etl\jupyterlab-amphi\packages\pipeline-components-local for components that are not packaged with amphi for snowflake (Snowpark pandas).
 
2. component is mainly composed of two parts : the form and the code generator. you can have some form examples in developer\FormExample.tsx
 
3. component must be registered in two indexes files:
amphi-etl\jupyterlab-amphi\packages\pipeline-components-core\src\index.ts
amphi-etl\jupyterlab-amphi\packages\pipeline-components-core\src\components\index.ts
 
4. icons are stored in  amphi-etl\jupyterlab-amphi\packages\pipeline-components-core\style\icons\ 
it must me registered  in amphi-etl\jupyterlab-amphi\packages\pipeline-components-core\src\icon.ts and the icon is a svg square of 24.
The privileged icon library is https://helios.hashicorp.design/icons/library

5. Component categories are created on the fly, with the super{} function, you don‚Äôt need to create a category.
