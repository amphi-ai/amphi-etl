============
Installation
============

PySpark is included in the official releases of Spark available in the `Apache Spark website <https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html>`_.
For Python users, PySpark also provides ``pip`` installation from PyPI. This is usually for local usage or as
a client to connect to a cluster instead of setting up a cluster itself.
 
This page includes instructions for installing PySpark by using pip, Conda, downloading manually,
and building from the source.


Python Versions Supported
-------------------------

Python 3.8 and above.


Using PyPI
----------

PySpark installation using `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/>`_ is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyspark

If you want to install extra dependencies for a specific component, you can install it as below:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Spark SQL
    pip install pyspark[sql]
    # pandas API on Spark
    pip install pyspark[pandas_on_spark] plotly  # to plot your data, you can install plotly together.
    # Spark Connect
    pip install pyspark[connect]

For PySpark with/without a specific Hadoop version, you can install it by using ``PYSPARK_HADOOP_VERSION`` environment variables as below:

.. code-block:: bash

    PYSPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=3 pip install pyspark

The default distribution uses Hadoop 3.3 and Hive 2.3. If users specify different versions of Hadoop, the pip installation automatically
downloads a different version and uses it in PySpark. Downloading it can take a while depending on
the network and the mirror chosen. ``PYSPARK_RELEASE_MIRROR`` can be set to manually choose the mirror for faster downloading.

.. code-block:: bash

    PYSPARK_RELEASE_MIRROR=http://mirror.apache-kr.org PYSPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=3 pip install

It is recommended to use ``-v`` option in ``pip`` to track the installation and download status.

.. code-block:: bash

    PYSPARK_HADOOP_VERSION=3 pip install pyspark -v

Supported values in ``PYSPARK_HADOOP_VERSION`` are:

- ``without``: Spark pre-built with user-provided Apache Hadoop
- ``3``: Spark pre-built for Apache Hadoop 3.3 and later (default)

Note that this installation of PySpark with/without a specific Hadoop version is experimental. It can change or be removed between minor releases.


Using Conda
-----------

Conda is an open-source package management and environment management system (developed by
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_), which is best installed through
`Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html/>`_ or `Miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/>`_.
The tool is both cross-platform and language agnostic, and in practice, conda can replace both
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ and `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_.

Conda uses so-called channels to distribute packages, and together with the default channels by
Anaconda itself, the most important channel is `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_, which
is the community-driven packaging effort that is the most extensive & the most current (and also
serves as the upstream for the Anaconda channels in most cases).

To create a new conda environment from your terminal and activate it, proceed as shown below:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n pyspark_env
    conda activate pyspark_env

After activating the environment, use the following command to install pyspark,
a python version of your choice, as well as other packages you want to use in
the same session as pyspark (you can install in several steps too).

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge pyspark  # can also add "python=3.8 some_package [etc.]" here

Note that `PySpark for conda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyspark>`_ is maintained
separately by the community; while new versions generally get packaged quickly, the
availability through conda(-forge) is not directly in sync with the PySpark release cycle.

While using pip in a conda environment is technically feasible (with the same command as
`above <#using-pypi>`_), this approach is `discouraged <https://www.anaconda.com/blog/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment/>`_,
because pip does not interoperate with conda.

For a short summary about useful conda commands, see their
`cheat sheet <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html/>`_.


Manually Downloading
--------------------

PySpark is included in the distributions available at the `Apache Spark website <https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html>`_.
You can download a distribution you want from the site. After that, uncompress the tar file into the directory where you want
to install Spark, for example, as below:

.. parsed-literal::

    tar xzvf spark-\ |release|\-bin-hadoop3.tgz

Ensure the ``SPARK_HOME`` environment variable points to the directory where the tar file has been extracted.
Update ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable such that it can find the PySpark and Py4J under ``SPARK_HOME/python/lib``.
One example of doing this is shown below:

.. parsed-literal::

    cd spark-\ |release|\-bin-hadoop3
    export SPARK_HOME=`pwd`
    export PYTHONPATH=$(ZIPS=("$SPARK_HOME"/python/lib/*.zip); IFS=:; echo "${ZIPS[*]}"):$PYTHONPATH


Installing from Source
----------------------

To install PySpark from source, refer to |building_spark|_.
